# CTC22
This is the home repository for [CTC22: the Environment](https://codethecity.org/code-the-city-22-the-environment/), which runs Saturday 20th March 2021 and Sunday 21rst March 2021. 

On Saturday we x participants working on y challenges. On Sunday we had y participants working on x challenges.

We used our main Zoom session to hold the space and alternated between main room where everyone should be together, and breakout rooms for group work in 90 minutes blocks of time. We then came back together to check in on how teams were getting on, and to share information and offers of help.

We used Slack and our Code the City workgroup as the back channel between rooms, and to coordinate the event outside of Zoom. This worked well in the run-up to the event, and also as the jumping off point for each day.

??? We added the use of Miro to the mix this time. Participants were encouraged to add a photo and something about what they had to offer, and also what they hoped to gain from the event, so that people knew more about each other. We also had a whiteboard for each team too. Some used this as a task board, others documented their work process, and others captured notes and brainstormed use cases and scenarios.
